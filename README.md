# River-Simulator-

The River Simulator project is a dynamic ecosystem model designed to simulate the interactions between bears and fish in a river environment. At its core, the simulation involves creating and managing objects representing bears and fish, each with specific attributes such as age and hunger levels.

The Bear class tracks the bear's age and hunger score, while the Fish class monitors only age. The River class orchestrates the simulation by managing populations of bears and fish, advancing their age, and handling daily and weekly simulations. The river's state is displayed through methods that provide a snapshot of the current day, fish population, and bear population. 

In addition to basic population management, the simulation includes advanced features such as age-based removal of animals, hunger-driven feeding mechanisms for bears, and reproduction for both species. This project allows users to observe the lifecycle and interactions within a small river ecosystem, modeling the natural processes of aging, hunger, and reproduction over time.
